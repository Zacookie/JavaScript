# Create an Array
One way we can create an array is to use an *array literal*. An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets `[]`. Remember from the previous exercise, arrays can store any data type — we can have an array that holds all the same data types or an array that holds different data types.

Let’s take a closer look at the syntax in the array example:

- The array is represented by the square brackets [] and the content inside.
- Each content item inside an array is called an element.
- There are three different elements inside the array.
- Each element inside the array is a different data type.

We can also save an array to a variable. You may have noticed we did this in the previous exercise:
```js
let newYearsResolutions = ['Keep a journal', 'Take a falconry class', 'Learn to juggle'];
```

> Example Code
```js
const hobbies = ["coding", "reading", "learning"];
console.log(hobbies); // Prints [ 'coding', 'reading', 'learning' ]
```
