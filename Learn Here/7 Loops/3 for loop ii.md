# Looping in Reverse
#### What if we want the `for` loop to log `3`, `2`, `1`, and then 0? With simple modifications to the expressions, we can make our loop run backward!

#### To run a backward `for` loop, we must:

#### - Set the iterator variable to the highest desired value in the initialization expression.
#### - Set the stopping condition for when the iterator variable is less than the desired amount.
#### - The iterator should decrease in intervals after each iteration.
