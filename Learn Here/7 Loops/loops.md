# Loops
#### A *loop* is a programming tool that repeats a set of instructions until a specified condition, called a *stopping condition* is reached. As a programmer, you’ll find that you rely on loops all the time! You’ll hear the generic term *iterate* when referring to loops; iterate simply means “to repeat”.

#### When we need to reuse a task in our code, we often bundle that action in a function. Similarly, when we see that a process has to repeat multiple times in a row, we write a loop. Loops allow us to create efficient code that automates processes to make scalable, manageable programs.

#### As illustrated in the diagram, loops iterate or repeat an action until a specific condition is met. When the condition is met, the loop stops and the computer moves on to the next part of the program.
