# The Increment and Decrement Operator

#### Other mathematical assignment operators include the increment operator (`++`) and decrement operator (`--`).

#### The increment operator will increase the value of the variable by 1. The decrement operator will decrease the value of the variable by 1. For example:
```js
let a = 10;
a++;
console.log(a); // Output: 11
```
```js
let b = 20;
b--;
console.log(b); // Output: 19
```
#### Just like the previous mathematical assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`), the variable’s value is updated and assigned as the new value of that variable.
